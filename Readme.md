# Sensation Meter

Welcome to **SensationMeter**. This is an experimental android application used to help urology patients keep track of their fluid intake and out. Tracking period can be decided by the responsible health care professionals. The tracked records for each user will be then turned into an individual excel file for health care professionals to review. The main point of the application is to provide data for studying relation between urge to pee and the mind. The entire software is written in Kotlin. To protect user information and prevent any leak of personally identifiable information, the application is designed to have no connection to a network.

This app is divided into 3 main parts excluding the settings page, which is only accessible to the administrator of the experiment.
